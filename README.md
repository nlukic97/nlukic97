# Nikola Lukic
Hi, my name is Nikola (Nick), and I'm a Blockchain Developer. I enjoy developing Frontend and Backend application, as well as decentralized application on EVM based blockchains.

The inner workings of web based systems, which are often taken for granted, is something that fascinates me.

My experience includes lecturing a university course at the SAE Institute of Belgrade.

Here's a project I'm very proud of - a [command line simulated in the browser](https://nlukic97.github.io).
(best to view this on Desktop for an additional perc ðŸ™‚)

## Improving My Old Repositories
I recently began re-visiting code I wrote as a student in 2020. I decided to update these repositories in order to implement knowledge gained in security, code optimization, and in general implementing good code practises. Here are a few of those repositories:
