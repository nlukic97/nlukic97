## My Open source contributions
Here are a few open source contributions I've made:

-  [fen-validator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fen-validator) -  package used to validate the Chess FEN notation. I added type checking to the package to prevent accidental errors. Pull request [here](https://github.com/jayasurian123/fen-validator/pull/23).

-  [laravel-cookie-consent](https://github.com/whitecube/laravel-cookie-consent) - php package used to register, configure and ask for cookies consent in a EU-compliant way. I made updates to prevent `undefined variable` errors when submiting cookie consent preferences. Pull request [here](https://github.com/whitecube/laravel-cookie-consent/pull/89).

-  [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) learning platform. The mission of FreeCodeCamp: to help people learn to code for free. I clarified the directions for a practise task. Pull request [here](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/pull/53611).
