# Nikola Lukic
I'm Nikola (Nick), a Full Stack Blockchain Developer. I develop Front-end and Back-end applications, as well as decentralized applications on EVM based blockchains such as Ethereum, Avalanche, and Polygon.

The inner workings of web based systems, which are often taken for granted, is something that fascinates me.

My experience includes lecturing a Web Development University course at the SAE Institute.

Here's a project I'm very proud of - a [command line simulated in the browser](https://nlukic97.github.io) inspired by a windows console emulator I use (open the link on your Desktop browser for an additional perc ðŸ™‚).

## Open source contributions
- [My contribution](https://github.com/jayasurian123/fen-validator/pull/23) to the npm package [fen-validator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fen-validator). The package was used in [the backend](https://github.com/nlukic97/chess_platform_server) of a chess platform I built.
I added type checking to prevent accidental errors.

- [My contribution](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/pull/53611) to the [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) learning platform. The mission of FreeCodeCamp: to help people learn to code for free. I clarified the directions for a practise task.

## Improving My Old Repositories
I recently began re-visiting code I wrote as a student in 2020. I started updating these projects to implement knowledge gained in security, code optimization, best code practise. Here are a few of those projects:
